# Keylogger

The Keylogger â€“ Capture Every Keystroke project  aims to demonstrate how malicious 
software, like keyloggers, operate in real-world environments by developing a functional 
keylogger in C++ for Windows Server 2016. Keyloggers are a type of surveillance malware that 
silently records every keystroke a user makes, potentially exposing sensitive data such as login 
credentials, credit card numbers, and personal messages. This project provides a hands-on 
learning experience, enhancing understanding of keylogger creation, persistence techniques in 
cybersecurity. 
The core problem statement addressed by this project is the lack of practical, hands-on 
experience in keylogger and its  behavior among cybersecurity learners. While theoretical 
knowledge is valuable, real insight into how malware functions can only be gained by simulating 
its development and observing its operation in a safe, isolated environment. This keylogger 
project bridges that gap by allowing us to design, build, and test a malware sample from 
scratch. 
The project uses tools such as Visual C++ Build Tools (VS 2019), the Developer Command 
Prompt, Notepad, and Windows APIs (User32.lib, Advapi32.lib). The controlled 
environment is a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine(VMware), ensuring safe testing and 
analysis. 
Unlike traditional methods that rely on analyzing precompiled malware, this project emphasizes 
the development process, giving a deeper understanding of malware internals. It highlights how 
simple code can be turned into a persistent threat and teaches how to recognize and counteract 
such behavior. 
In conclusion, the expected output is a functioning keylogger that logs keystrokes, persists 
through reboots, and hides its presence, providing a realistic simulation of malware behavior. 
This project reinforces critical cybersecurity concepts such as threat detection, malware evasion 
techniques, and ethical considerations.
